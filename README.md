This project aims to improve my skills in using React Router and Tailwind CSS. It is a simple web application that simulates an online guitar store. Users can add their desired guitar to a shopping cart along with various accessories, and the total price is displayed dynamically. Furthermore, I utilize CreateContext and useReducer for effective state management.
